DISCLAIMER FOR THEORETICAL RESEARCH

This software implements theoretical models and simulations for research
purposes in quantum gravity and related fields. The theoretical frameworks
implemented here are:

- Based on current understanding of quantum mechanics and general relativity
- Represent novel theoretical proposals that are subject to scientific scrutiny
- May not reflect confirmed physical reality and should be interpreted as
  research tools for theoretical exploration
- Results should be validated through peer review and experimental verification

Users should approach results with appropriate scientific skepticism and
follow standard practices for theoretical physics research.
